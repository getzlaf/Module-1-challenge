# Module-1-challenge
analyses of the kickstarter dataset
## Overview of Project

### Purpose
Louise is designing a play (Fever) and she wants to know how other comparable funding campaigns did in terms of money raised in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. It is our duty to provide her a clear analysis based on the data we collected from the Kickstarter data sheet. 
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
We did not face any particular challenge. We sometimes had to check on the Microsoft website to get mild help on sorting the campaign outcomes in descending order or getting more info on the COUNTIFS function. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
The month where there are the most successful campaigns is May. It is also the month where you have the best chance of succeeding your campaign with a ratio of 67%. 
On the other hand, December is the worst month to launch a campaign based on that dataset. You only have a ratio of 49% on having a successful campaign. You have more chance to fail or to cancel than succeed. We recommend to Louise to launch her campaign in May.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Based on this dataset, you have a higher chance to succeed your campaign if your goal is low (0 to $4999). Interestingly, between $35000 and $44999 you have more chance to succeed than $5000 to $34999. We recommend to Louise to have a small project (0 to 4999) or a medium project (35000 to 44999). 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We do not have a column on the type of each play. Maybe some campaigns are successful because they promote a project that interest more people. For example, a classic play (i.e Romeo and Juliet) may be more popular than expressionism theater. We do not have this classification in the dataset.
We also have no idea on the economic circumstances that may affect the outcome of a funding campaign. For example, if there was a huge recession during the data collection process it might change your perception of the reality. It might not be because the project was not interesting that the funding campaign failed, it might be because the investors did not want to spend money on that at this particular time. Adding a column about the GDP growth and the employment rate would give an idea about the economic environment.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could have made the same graphs but sorting by the country in which Louise play will take place. It might have a great influence on the decision will take. For instance, the best month to launch a funding campaign in her country might not be the same one when we agregated the data and showed it to her.
